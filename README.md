# Kagura Emote System

The structure of shown scripts does NOT represent the structure of my project.  
This is simply a list of scripts that I use for that specific system, to showcase what you can expect from me.

**Why don't I use --!strict?**  
This project has been started over a year ago - at that point I didn't care about strict typing.  
I use strict typing on all new projects/commissions.
